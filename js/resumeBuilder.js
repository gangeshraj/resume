I worked on calendar component of homepage which was completely developed without usage of any libraries. It was developed with only typescript and its inbuilt functions.This calendar is having different perspective in terms of UI and functionality for different views. According to source,destination,flight availability the fares are fetched and shown on the dates.Also for two way and one way journey the range of the dates are shown in continious colurful pattern.Contributed to each project delivery phase (analysis, development, test, ops) in different roles."
